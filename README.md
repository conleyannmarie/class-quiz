Module 4 challenge 
Needed to create a quiz of my own that is timed! With each chosen answer it moves on to the next question. Timer is shown and is counting down. With each wrong answer timer decreases by 5 seconds. Game ends when timer runs out or all questions are answered.
End of game shows score and allows you to save our initials and score to local storage
